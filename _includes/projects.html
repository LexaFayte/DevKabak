              <h3>Law Enforcement VR - L.E.V.R</h3>
              <p>Law Enforcemtn VR is a proof-of-concept project which takes the original virtual scenario training idea, currently used by law enforcement, and brings it into virtual reality. The concept was to provide more immersive 360° scenarios using VR, as well as aleviate the need for instructor operation by adding in voice recognition to progress scenarios. The application was developed for Windows 10 PC's using C#, Unity, Adobe FUSE and Mixamo, SRGS grXML, and the SteamVR library.
              </p>
              <p>The project was completed for the major project (practicum) requirement of the bachelor's degree program at BCIT, and had only one contributer, Alexandra Kabak.</p>
