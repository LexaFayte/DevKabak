              <h3>Staged!</h3>
              <p>"Staged!" is a short turn based adventure game for PC and Xbox 360, and was developed in the first semester of the bachelor's degree programmed by
                 a team of four students:<br/>Nav Batthi, Alexandra Kabak, Christopher Klassen, Ren√© Ye<br/>
              </p>
              <p>An unlikely trio of characters wake up at the bottom of a dungeon;none know one another, and none know how they ended up down there.
                Greeted by a mysterious voice, they are informed that their only hope of escape is to fight their way through the dungeon, together.
